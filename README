   This is a very early stage of an Active shutter 3D homebrew system
Compose of a transmitter (expected to be connected to a computer one day)
that is made of Longan Nano (GD32VF103CBT6 Risc-V microcontroller) nowadays
just sending a sync signal thow a FS1000A 433Mhz transmitter.
The other component is the receiver, made of an Alhambra II (iCE40HX4K-TQ144
FPGA Development Board) connected to a RF-5V 433Mhz receiver on one side and
to the left and right shutter in the other (Connected throw external
transistor circuit for handle the 8V that it needs).

The receiver is already working, it get a sync signal, calculate the period
time and open-close the lens during one cycle (half cycle per lens), doesn't
matter the frequency between 1KHZ and 4HZ, the frequency can change
dynamically and the FPGA will adapt to it.

The transmitter is just sending a sync signal while switch on a led for
test that glases are sync and the led light cam be seen just from one of the
lens.

TODO:

In the transmitter side, A lot...
Would be nice to modify the FBDEV module for send a signal throw the USB
from while to while with screen refresh rate and start of it, then the
Risc-V can get it and compose the signal.
